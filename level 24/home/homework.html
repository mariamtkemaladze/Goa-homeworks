    <p class="p1">
        My name is Mariam Tkemaladze. I was born in 2010, in Tbilisi, Goergia. My birthday is on 8th March. I was an only child until my first brother was born in 2014. 8 years later, in 2022, my second brother was born. I'm the oldest child. I live with my parents, grandma and 2 younger brothers. I loved music since deep childhood, so my parents signed me up for singing classes when I was only 3 years old. When I turned 4, I left singing and joined Bastibubu's team, where I used to learn singing and dancing together. I loved being there, but this happiness only lasted for 2 years. After 2 years, I turned 6 and had to start school.

<h2 class="title3">WHEN I WAS 6-13YO</h2>
<p class="p2">
    I made new friends when I started school. I was doing quite good in school since 1sth grade. In the 2nd grade, I started to take swimming and Georgian dance classes. I left swimming after 2 years, but I continued to dance for 4 years. Then, Covid started and becouse of the pandemy, I couldn't go to school nor dance, so I left my favorite thing: dancing.
    Later, when virus started to slowly fade away, us, students, were able to learn at school again and everyone was so happy, becouse we barely learned anything through online lessons. I used to attend different kind of a competitions at that age, so I have a lot achievments. Even tho I had good grades at school, I still wasn't satisfied with my life, becouse I was lacking music in it. that's when I started to play guitar. I was 13 at that time. Playing guitar became my favourite hobby.

    <h2 class="title4">MY LIFE NOWDAYS</h2>
    <p class="p3"> As you can see, music plays a big role in my life. Listening to the music brings me so much joy. Besides the music, I was always interested in computer sience and programming. My dream was to become a dancer or therapist, but I realised that with these jobs, I can't afford the future I want. I am good at math and English, so I thought that programming would be a perfect job for me. That's when my mom saw GOA's post on social media. She asked me if I wanted to start programming lessons and I agreed.Since I started programming, my life got better. Now I know what I want to do in the future and I have my own goals to achieve, which gives me so much motivation. I met the best mentor and got so much friends at GOA. I especially remember my first Hackathon, where I made new friends and had so much fun, also learned so much about programming. Besides that, I do Taekwondo which I really love. I love my team and I'm always doing my best in sport too to get as many 1st places as possible and to achieve my dreams. Even tho I do a lot's of things, I still can't get over the dancing, so I'm gonna join it from the next year. I'm turning 15 soon and I'm so thankful for GOA, becouse without GOA, I wouldn't be sitting here and workiing on my own site. GOA is the best!</p>
